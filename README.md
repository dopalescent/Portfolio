# <Challenge 2: Professional Portfolio>

## Description

- In this project, we created a webpage to act as a professional portfolio for showcasing our development capabilities.
- Completing this project required building and styling a webpage with no starter code.
- Positioning of elements required a competent understanding of element nesting, display boxes, and flexbox attributes.
- The finished product met parameters such that design elements remained coherent on a full spectrum of device viewports.
- In all, this project allowed me to demonstrate an advanced understanding of CSS styling and responsive layouts.
